# ASCII_RPG_IN_C
A old rpg made for experiment.

need code block.
you need to set follow step below:

you need to link winmm Library.

1. setting/compiler/Linker Settings.

2. add winmm on left textbox.

3. fill -static on right textbox.

一個很久以前做的RPG，大概2021左右，沒怎麼碰過了，但會承載這一個作品的理想，到之後的引擎中。

```
ver 2.0 use struct rather than array to save the file.
ver 3.0 save system based on structure.But skin cannot be saved.
fixed the save bug. Now can save skin;

upgrade the save form and now can detect and delete save_file.

Now NPC can move

Add act select feature;
ver4.0 NPC now can interact.
ver5.0 Now can load different maps.

Now can use key to change act mode: W to move, T to talk, A to attack.
```
